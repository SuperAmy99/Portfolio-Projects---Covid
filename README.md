# Data Analysis Project - COVID-19 Deaths

My data analysis project is based on data from an open-source data website called "Our World in Data". You can find the data at the following link: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

I downloaded the data from the website and split it into two CSV documents. 
After that, I uploaded the data to BigQuery for further analysis.
